# Project Progress Report

This document summarizes the implementation progress based on the stories outlined in `mcp_stories.md`.

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 1: Database (Supabase) & Schema
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
  - The `mcp_server` directory has been created.
  - An `.env.example` file has been added to `mcp_server` with placeholders for Supabase and Gemini keys.
  - A `db/schema.sql` file has been created with the SQL statements to create the `users`, `messages`, and `embeddings` tables in Supabase.

### Sprint 2: Node.js Gateway (Auth + Routing)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
  - The `axios` dependency was added to the `backend`.
  - The `backend/src/routes/session.js` file was updated to include a `/api/chat` endpoint. This endpoint verifies the user's session and forwards chat requests to the `mcp_server`.
  - A `/api/history` endpoint was also added to fetch chat history from the `mcp_server`.

### Sprint 3: Python MCP Server Skeleton & Tools
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
  - A FastAPI application has been scaffolded in `mcp_server/main.py` with `/health`, `/mcp/query`, and `/mcp/history` endpoints.
  - A `requirements.txt` file has been created listing all necessary Python dependencies.
  - A `supabase_client.py` module was created to handle all interactions with the Supabase database (getting/creating users, storing messages, fetching history).
  - A `tools` directory was created with `user_tools.py` and `chat_tools.py` to provide a clean interface for accessing user and chat data.

### Sprint 4: Gemini Integration (LLM Orchestration)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
  - An `ai_client.py` module was created to wrap the Gemini API. It includes a `generate_from_prompt` function that sends the user's message and chat history to the Gemini model.
  - The `/mcp/query` endpoint in `main.py` was updated to use the `ai_client` and `tools` to generate a contextual response. It now fetches user/chat history, generates a reply, stores both the user's message and the AI's reply, and returns the reply to the gateway.

### Sprint 5: Frontend Chatbot UI & Integration
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
  - A new `ChatBot.jsx` component was created to provide the chat interface.
  - The `Dashboard.jsx` page was updated to include the `ChatBot` component, with a toggle button to show/hide it.
  - The `api.js` service was updated with functions to send messages and get chat history.
  - CSS styles for the chat widget were added to `App.css`.

### Sprint 6: Testing, Security Hardening & CI
- **Status:** Partially Complete
- **Details:**
  - Structured logging has been added to the `mcp_server/main.py` to log requests, responses, and errors, improving traceability and making debugging easier.
  - Unit/integration tests and rate limiting have not yet been implemented.
