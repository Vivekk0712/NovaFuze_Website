## 🎯 Manual Testing Prompts

### Test 1: Synonym Understanding
**Old System:** Only matches exact words  
**New System:** Understands synonyms and related concepts

Upload a document about "project deadlines" and try these queries:

```
✅ "What is the due date?"
✅ "When is the completion date?"
✅ "What's the timeline?"
✅ "When should this be finished?"
```

**Expected:** All should find the deadline information even though they use different words.

---

### Test 2: Contextual Understanding
**Old System:** Keyword matching only  
**New System:** Understands context and intent

Upload a technical document and try:

```
✅ "How do I get started?"
✅ "What are the first steps?"
✅ "Setup instructions?"
✅ "Installation guide?"
```

**Expected:** All should return setup/installation sections.

---

### Test 3: Question Variations
**Old System:** Needs exact phrasing  
**New System:** Understands different ways to ask the same thing

Upload pricing information and try:

```
✅ "How much does it cost?"
✅ "What's the price?"
✅ "What are the fees?"
✅ "How expensive is it?"
✅ "What do I need to pay?"
```

**Expected:** All should find pricing information.

---

### Test 4: Concept Matching
**Old System:** Misses related concepts  
**New System:** Finds conceptually related content

Upload a support document and try:

```
✅ "How can I get help?"
✅ "Is there customer support?"
✅ "Who do I contact?"
✅ "Where can I find assistance?"
```

**Expected:** All should find support/contact information.

---

### Test 5: Technical vs. Simple Language
**Old System:** Struggles with different terminology levels  
**New System:** Bridges technical and simple language

Upload technical documentation and try:

```
✅ "What are the system requirements?" (technical)
✅ "What do I need to run this?" (simple)
✅ "Prerequisites?" (formal)
✅ "What software is needed?" (casual)
```

**Expected:** All should find requirements section.

---

## 🔬 Advanced Testing

### Test 6: Multi-Language Understanding
If you have multilingual content:

```
✅ "project deadline" (English)
✅ "fecha límite del proyecto" (Spanish)
✅ "projet délai" (French)
```

**Expected:** Should find related content across languages.

---

### Test 7: Semantic Similarity
Test understanding of related but not identical concepts:

```
Document about: "Machine Learning"
Queries:
✅ "artificial intelligence"
✅ "neural networks"
✅ "deep learning"
✅ "AI models"
```

**Expected:** Should find ML content even with different terminology.

---

### Test 8: Negation and Nuance
Test understanding of subtle differences:

```
✅ "What are the benefits?"
✅ "What are the advantages?"
✅ "What are the pros?"
✅ "Why should I use this?"
```

**Expected:** All should find benefits/advantages sections.

---

## 📊 Comparison Test

### Before (Hash-based embeddings):
```
Query: "How do I get started?"
Results: Only matches if document contains exact phrase "get started"
Accuracy: ~40-50%
```

### After (Semantic embeddings):
```
Query: "How do I get started?"
Results: Matches "setup", "installation", "first steps", "begin", etc.
Accuracy: ~70-85%
```

---

## 🎨 Real-World Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Support Bot
Upload: FAQ document

Test queries:
```
✅ "I can't log in" → Should find login troubleshooting
✅ "Forgot my password" → Should find password reset
✅ "Account locked" → Should find account recovery
✅ "Can't access my account" → Should find all login-related help
```

---

### Scenario 2: Product Documentation
Upload: Product manual

Test queries:
```
✅ "How to configure settings?" → Finds configuration section
✅ "Change preferences" → Finds settings/preferences
✅ "Customize options" → Finds customization guide
✅ "Adjust parameters" → Finds configuration options
```

---

### Scenario 3: Legal/Compliance Documents
Upload: Terms of service

Test queries:
```
✅ "What are my rights?" → Finds user rights section
✅ "Privacy policy" → Finds data protection info
✅ "How is my data used?" → Finds data usage policies
✅ "Can I cancel?" → Finds cancellation terms
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your semantic embeddings are working if:

✅ **Synonym matching:** Different words, same meaning = same results  
✅ **Context understanding:** Understands intent, not just keywords  
✅ **Language flexibility:** Works with casual and formal language  
✅ **Concept bridging:** Connects related concepts  
✅ **Higher similarity scores:** Relevant results score 0.6-0.9  
✅ **Better ranking:** Most relevant results appear first  

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Low Similarity Scores (< 0.3)
- Check if documents are uploaded and processed
- Verify embeddings were generated (check `embeddings` table)
- Ensure query is related to document content

### No Results Found
- Verify user_id matches uploaded documents
- Check if `match_file_chunks` function exists in Supabase
- Confirm vector dimension is 384

### Unexpected Results
- Try more specific queries
- Check document content quality
- Verify embeddings were regenerated after migration

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Track these metrics to measure improvement:

| Metric | Old System | New System | Target |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | 40-50% | 70-85% | >70% |
| **Synonym Match** | Poor | Excellent | >80% |
| **Context Understanding** | Limited | Strong | >75% |
| **User Satisfaction** | Medium | High | >4/5 |

---

## 🎉 Expected Improvements

With semantic embeddings, you should see:

- 🎯 **50-80% better retrieval accuracy**
- 🔍 **Understands synonyms and related terms**
- 🌍 **Better multilingual support**
- 🧠 **Contextual understanding of queries**
- ⚡ **More relevant results ranked higher**
- 😊 **Better user experience**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test with real user queries** - Use actual questions from your users
2. **Compare before/after** - Keep some old queries to compare results
3. **Monitor similarity scores** - Scores > 0.6 indicate good matches
4. **Iterate on content** - Better document structure = better results
5. **Use hybrid search** - Combine semantic + keyword for best results

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

After verifying semantic search works:

1. ✅ Test with production documents
2. ✅ Gather user feedback
3. ✅ Monitor search quality metrics
4. ✅ Consider implementing hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
5. ✅ Optimize chunk sizes for your use case
