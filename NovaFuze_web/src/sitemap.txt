MIGRATION PLANNING
==================
Since existing content export will be provided later, here's the recommended approach:

Current Site Analysis (To Be Completed):
  - Export current https://novafuze.in sitemap.xml or provide URL list
  - Identify high-value pages for SEO preservation
  - Create 301 redirect map: old_url -> new_url

Expected Migration Categories:
  - Static pages: About, Contact, Services → migrate to CMS Pages
  - Blog posts → migrate to BlogPost collection 
  - Team pages → migrate to TeamMember collection
  - Service pages → migrate to Service collection
  - Product pages → migrate to Product collection (with external redirects)

Redirect Strategy (Examples):
  https://novafuze.in/old-service-page/ → /services/new-service-slug/
  https://novafuze.in/old-blog-post/ → /blog/migrated-post-slug/
  https://novafuze.in/team/old-member/ → /about-us/member-slug/
